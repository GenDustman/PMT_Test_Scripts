# PMT_Test_Scripts
Here are the scripts we have been using during our PMT testing for D2O Module 2. There are two folders for two different kinds of tests since the machinery is a little different, one is for dark box tests ``Darkbox`` and the other is for underwater tests ``UnderWater``. Comments in ``WaveDump_config.docx`` explained the meaning of each entry in the configuration file.
