#Dark Box Test
``Analysis_PMT_darkbox.ipynb`` is the script to directly analyze the data named with ``PMT%d_lighton_%d.dat`` or ``PMT%d_dark_%d.dat``, which means the ``PMT%d`` in ``lighton`` or ``dark`` at ``%d`` Volts. It will geanerate the histograms for areas of pulses in light-on and dark condition, along with the Gain vs Voltage and photon-number for each voltage.
